<h1 class="titleFont newLine">You walk along the Python Path until you arrive at Module 1's Home.</h1>
You knock on the door. A second later, a young boy opens it.

<br><br>
"Huh? Who... Who are you? Oh, you're here to see my dad, Module 1."<br><br>

"Well, he'll be back soon. But... Did you know I went on some of the journey too? I got my own function, and they
called me <em>Module 0</em>. Here, I'll show you!" <br><br>
<hr>
<h3 class="newLine">You enter.</h3>

Module 0 runs upstairs and comes back with a golden square triangle.

"Look! I wrote down my function on this!"

        It multiplies these values, then divides by two to get the area of the triangle, rounds the result, and prints out
        the rounded area in centimetres squared.
